The size and scale of Spark Summit 2017 is a true reflection of innovation after innovation that has made itself into the Apache Spark project. Databricks is proud to share excerpts from the upcoming book, Spark: The Definitive Guide. Enjoy this free preview copy, courtesy of Databricks, of chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5 and subscribe to the Databricks blog for upcoming chapter releases.\\n\\n2\\n\\nA Gentle Introduction to Spark\\n\\nNow that we took our history lesson on Apache Spark, it’s time to start using it and applying it! This chapter will present a gentle introduction to Spark - we will walk through the core architecture of a cluster, Spark Application, and Spark’s Structured APIs using DataFrames and SQL. Along the way we will touch on Spark’s core terminology and concepts so that you are empowered start using Spark right away. Let’s get started with some basic background terminology and concepts.\\n\\nSpark’s Basic Architecture\\n\\nTypically when you think of a “computer” you think about one machine sitting on your desk at home or at work. This machine works perfectly well for watching movies or working with spreadsheet software. However, as many users likely experience at some point, there are some things that your computer is not powerful enough to perform. One particularly challenging area is data processing. Single machines do not have enough power and resources to perform computations on huge amounts of information (or the user may not have time to wait for the computation to finish). A cluster, or group of machines, pools the resources of many machines together allowing us to use all the cumulative resources as if they were one. Now a group of machines alone is not powerful, you need a framework to coordinate work across them. Spark is a tool for just that, managing and coordinating the execution of tasks on data across a cluster of computers.\\n\\nThe cluster of machines that Spark will leverage to execute tasks will be managed by a cluster manager like Spark’s Standalone cluster manager, YARN, or Mesos. We then submit Spark Applications to these cluster managers which will grant resources to our application so that we can complete our work.\\n\\nSpark Applications\\n\\nSpark Applications consist of a driver process and a set of executor processes. The driver process runs your main() function, sits on a node in the cluster, and is responsible for three things: maintaining information about the Spark Application; responding to a user’s program or input; and analyzing, distributing, and scheduling work across the executors (defined momentarily). The driver process is absolutely essential - it’s the heart of a Spark Application and maintains all relevant information during the lifetime of the application.\\n\\nThe executors are responsible for actually executing the work that the driver assigns them. This means, each executor is responsible for only two things: executing code assigned to it by the driver and reporting the state of the computation, on that executor, back to the driver node.\\n\\n3\\n\\nSpark Application\\n\\nJVM\\n\\nTo Executors\\n\\nSpark Session\\n\\nUser Code\\n\\nFigure 1:\\n\\nThe cluster manager controls physical machines and allocates resources to Spark Applications. This can be one of several core cluster managers: Spark’s standalone cluster manager, YARN, or Mesos. This means that there can be multiple Spark Applications running on a cluster at the same time. We will talk more in depth about cluster managers in Part IV: Production Applications of this book.\\n\\nIn the previous illustration we see on the left, our driver and on the right the four executors on the right. In this diagram, we removed the concept of cluster nodes. The user can specify how many executors should fall on each node through configurations.\\n\\nnote', metadata={'chunk': 0.0, 'data_source': 'Local', 'id': 'e325e387a7fd41e28cc2258dd25dc0e2', 'page': 'None', 'source': 'JAf9pE-The-Data-Engineers-Guide-to-Apache-Spark.pdf'}),\n",

This chapter aims for breadth, instead of depth. Let’s get started!\\nProduction Applications\\nSpark makes it easy to make simple to reason about and simple to evolve big data programs. Spark also makes it easy \\nto turn in your interactive exploration into production applications with a tool called spark-submit  that is included \\nin the core of Spark. spark-submit does one thing, it allows you to submit your applications to a currently managed \\ncluster to run. When you submit this, the application will run until the application exists or errors. You can do this with \\nall of Spark’s support cluster managers including Standalone, Mesos, and YARN.\\nIn the process of doing so, you have a number of knobs that you can turn and control to specify the resources this \\napplication has as well, how it should be run, and the parameters for your specific application.\\nYou can write these production applications in any of Spark’s supported languages and then submit those \\napplications for execution. The simplest example is one that you can do on your local machine by running the \\nfollowing command line snippet on your local machine in the directory into which you downloaded Spark.\\n./bin/spark-submit \\\\  \\n  --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \\\\  \\n  --master local \\\\  \\n  ./examples/jars/spark-examples_2. 11-2.2.0 .jar 10\\nWhat this will do is calculate the digits of pi to a certain level of estimation.

Important innovations (for example, telephone lines, credit card systems, the Internet, and mobile technologies) have improved the convenience, speed, and efficiency of transactions while shrinking — and sometimes virtually eliminating — the distance between buyers and sellers.\\n\\nIn spite of this, many business transactions remain ineffi- cient, expensive, and vulnerable, suffering from the following limitations:\\n\\n» Cash is useful only in local transactions and in relatively small\\n\\namounts.\\n\\n» The time between transaction and settlement can be long. » Duplication of effort and the need for third-party validation and/or the presence of intermediaries add to inefficiencies. » Fraud, cyberattacks, and even simple mistakes add to the cost and complexity of doing business, exposing all partici- pants in the network to risk if a central system — such as a bank — is compromised.\\n\\n» Credit card organizations are walled gardens with a high price of entry. Merchants must pay the high costs of onboarding, which often involves considerable paperwork and a time-consuming vetting process.\\n\\n» Half of the world’s people don’t have access to bank\\n\\naccounts, requiring them to develop parallel payment systems to conduct transactions.\\n\\n» Limited transparency and inconsistent information hinder the efficient movement of goods in the shipping industry.\\n\\nTransaction volumes worldwide are growing exponentially and will surely magnify the complexities, vulnerabilities, inefficien- cies, and costs of current transaction systems.

And transaction volumes are exploding with the rise of Internet of Things (IoT) — autonomous objects, such as refrigerators that buy groceries when supplies are running low and cars that deliver themselves to your door, stop- ping for fuel along the way.\\n\\nTo address these challenges and others, the world needs faster payment networks that provide mechanisms to establish trust, require no specialized equipment, have no chargebacks or monthly fees, and offer a collective bookkeeping solution for ensuring transparency and trust.\\n\\nThe emergence of Bitcoin\\n\\nOne solution that’s been developed to address the complexities, vulnerabilities, inefficiencies, and costs of current transaction systems is Bitcoin — the digital currency launched in 2009 by a mysterious person (or persons) known only by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.', metadata={'chunk': 3.0, 'data_source': 'Local', 'id': '5aecc62b86cc4d32b781ae6f7b679894', 'page': 'None', 'source': 'Blockchain%20for%20Dummies.pdf'}),\n",

Bitcoin is \\nonly the first use case for blockchain.\\nRevolutionizing the Traditional \\nBusiness Network\\nWith traditional methods for recording transactions and track -\\ning assets, participants on a network keep their own ledgers and \\nother records. This traditional method can be expensive, partially because it involves intermediaries that charge fees for their ser -\\nvices. It’s clearly inefficient due to delays in executing agreements and the duplication of effort required to maintain numerous led-gers. It’s also vulnerable because if a central system (for example, a bank) is compromised due to fraud, cyberattack, or a simple mistake, the entire business network is affected.\\nBusiness networks also use blockchain. The blockchain architec -\\nture gives participants the ability to share a ledger that’s updated \\nthrough peer-to-peer replication each time a transaction occurs. Peer-to-peer replication  means that each participant (also called \\na node) in the network acts as both a publisher and a subscriber.', metadata={'chunk': 0.0, 'data_source': 'Local', 'id': '53b09eac9aaf43d2b49314af11e293d6', 'page': '10', 'source': 'Blockchain%20for%20Dummies.pdf'}),\n",

In this chapter, I tackle that topic by taking you behind the scenes of a blockchain network without getting overly technical.\\n\\nHere, you get a glimpse of how blockchain stores transactions in a way that prevents recorded transactions from being changed. You discover the four concepts that form the foundation of a blockchain for business, and you meet the network participants to learn the various roles they play.\\n\\nWhy It’s Called “Blockchain”\\n\\nBlockchain owes its name to the way it stores transaction data — in blocks that are linked together to form a chain (see Figure 2-1). As the number of transactions grows, so does the blockchain. Blocks record and confirm the time and sequence of transactions, which are then logged into the blockchain within a discrete net- work governed by rules agreed on by the network participants.\\n\\nCHAPTER 2 Taking a Look at How Blockchain Works 13\\n\\nThese materials are © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Any dissemination, distribution, or unauthorized use is strictly prohibited.\\n\\nFIGURE 2-1: Blockchain stores transaction records in a series of connected blocks.\\n\\nEach block contains a hash (a digital fingerprint or unique identi- fier), timestamped batches of recent valid transactions, and the hash of the previous block. The previous block hash links the blocks together and prevents any block from being altered or a block being inserted between two existing blocks. In this way, each subsequent block strengthens the verification of the previ- ous block and hence the entire blockchain. The method renders the blockchain tamper-evident, lending to the key attribute of immutability.\\n\\nTo be clear, while the blockchain contains transaction data, it’s not a replacement for databases, messaging technology, trans- action processing, or business processes. Instead, the blockchain contains verified proof of transactions. However, while blockchain essentially serves as a database for recording transactions, its benefits extend far beyond those of a traditional database. Most notably, it removes the possibility of tampering by a malicious actor (for example, a database administrator).\\n\\nWhat Makes a Blockchain Suitable for Business?\\n\\nInstead of having a blockchain that relies on the exchange of cryptocurrencies with anonymous users on a public network (as is the case with Bitcoin), a blockchain for business is a private, per- missioned network with known identities and without the need for cryptocurrencies.\\n\\n14 Blockchain For Dummies, 2nd IBM Limited Edition\\n\\nThese materials are © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Any dissemination, distribution, or unauthorized use is strictly prohibited.\\n\\nTo further understand how a blockchain for business works, and to appreciate its potential for revolutionizing business networks, you need to understand the four key concepts of blockchain for business (see Figure 2-2).\\n\\nFIGURE 2-2: The key concepts of blockchain for business.\\n\\nThese four concepts are explained in this section.\\n\\nShared ledger\\n\\nLedgers are nothing new; they’ve been used in double-entry bookkeeping since the 15th century. What is new is the concept of a shared, distributed ledger — an immutable record of all trans- actions on the network, a record that all network participants can access. With a shared ledger, transactions are recorded only once, eliminating the duplication of effort that’s typical of tra- ditional business networks. The shared ledger has the following characteristics:', metadata={'chunk': 7.0, 'data_source': 'Local', 'id': '5aecc62b86cc4d32b781ae6f7b679894', 'page': 'None', 'source': 'Blockchain%20for%20Dummies.pdf'}),\n",

Important innovations (for example, telephone lines, credit card systems, the Internet, and mobile technologies) have improved the convenience, speed, and efficiency of transactions while shrinking — and sometimes virtually eliminating — the distance between buyers and sellers.\\n\\nIn spite of this, many business transactions remain ineffi- cient, expensive, and vulnerable, suffering from the following limitations:\\n\\n» Cash is useful only in local transactions and in relatively small\\n\\namounts.\\n\\n» The time between transaction and settlement can be long. » Duplication of effort and the need for third-party validation and/or the presence of intermediaries add to inefficiencies. » Fraud, cyberattacks, and even simple mistakes add to the cost and complexity of doing business, exposing all partici- pants in the network to risk if a central system — such as a bank — is compromised.\\n\\n» Credit card organizations are walled gardens with a high price of entry. Merchants must pay the high costs of onboarding, which often involves considerable paperwork and a time-consuming vetting process.\\n\\n» Half of the world’s people don’t have access to bank\\n\\naccounts, requiring them to develop parallel payment systems to conduct transactions.\\n\\n» Limited transparency and inconsistent information hinder the efficient movement of goods in the shipping industry.\\n\\nTransaction volumes worldwide are growing exponentially and will surely magnify the complexities, vulnerabilities, inefficien- cies, and costs of current transaction systems.

And transaction volumes are exploding with the rise of Internet of Things (IoT) — autonomous objects, such as refrigerators that buy groceries when supplies are running low and cars that deliver themselves to your door, stop- ping for fuel along the way.\\n\\nTo address these challenges and others, the world needs faster payment networks that provide mechanisms to establish trust, require no specialized equipment, have no chargebacks or monthly fees, and offer a collective bookkeeping solution for ensuring transparency and trust.\\n\\nThe emergence of Bitcoin\\n\\nOne solution that’s been developed to address the complexities, vulnerabilities, inefficiencies, and costs of current transaction systems is Bitcoin — the digital currency launched in 2009 by a mysterious person (or persons) known only by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.', metadata={'chunk': 3.0, 'data_source': 'Local', 'id': '5aecc62b86cc4d32b781ae6f7b679894', 'page': 'None', 'source': 'Blockchain%20for%20Dummies.pdf'}),\n",

Think of blockchain as an oper-ating system, such as Microsoft Windows or MacOS, and Bitcoin as only one of the many applications that can run on that operat-ing system. Blockchain provides the means for recording Bitcoin transactions\\xa0— the shared ledger\\xa0— but this shared ledger can be used to record any transaction and track the movement of any asset whether tangible, intangible, or digital. For example, block-chain enables securities to be settled in minutes instead of days. It \\ncan also be used to help companies manage the flow of goods and \\nrelated payments, or enable manufacturers to share production logs with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and regula-tors to reduce product recalls.\\nThe takeaway lesson: Bitcoin and blockchain are not the same. \\nBlockchain provides the means to record and store Bitcoin trans -\\nactions, but blockchain has many uses beyond Bitcoin. Bitcoin is \\nonly the first use case for blockchain.\\nRevolutionizing the Traditional \\nBusiness Network\\nWith traditional methods for recording transactions and track -\\ning assets, participants on a network keep their own ledgers and \\nother records. This traditional method can be expensive, partially because it involves intermediaries that charge fees for their ser -\\nvices. It’s clearly inefficient due to delays in executing agreements and the duplication of effort required to maintain numerous led-gers. It’s also vulnerable because if a central system (for example, a bank) is compromised due to fraud, cyberattack, or a simple mistake, the entire business network is affected.\\nBusiness networks also use blockchain. The blockchain architec -\\nture gives participants the ability to share a ledger that’s updated \\nthrough peer-to-peer replication each time a transaction occurs. Peer-to-peer replication  means that each participant (also called \\na node) in the network acts as both a publisher and a subscriber.', metadata={'chunk': 0.0, 'data_source': 'Local', 'id': '53b09eac9aaf43d2b49314af11e293d6', 'page': '10', 'source': 'Blockchain%20for%20Dummies.pdf'}),\n",

In this chapter, I tackle that topic by taking you behind the scenes of a blockchain network without getting overly technical.\\n\\nHere, you get a glimpse of how blockchain stores transactions in a way that prevents recorded transactions from being changed. You discover the four concepts that form the foundation of a blockchain for business, and you meet the network participants to learn the various roles they play.\\n\\nWhy It’s Called “Blockchain”\\n\\nBlockchain owes its name to the way it stores transaction data — in blocks that are linked together to form a chain (see Figure 2-1). As the number of transactions grows, so does the blockchain. Blocks record and confirm the time and sequence of transactions, which are then logged into the blockchain within a discrete net- work governed by rules agreed on by the network participants.\\n\\nCHAPTER 2 Taking a Look at How Blockchain Works 13\\n\\nThese materials are © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Any dissemination, distribution, or unauthorized use is strictly prohibited.\\n\\nFIGURE 2-1: Blockchain stores transaction records in a series of connected blocks.\\n\\nEach block contains a hash (a digital fingerprint or unique identi- fier), timestamped batches of recent valid transactions, and the hash of the previous block. The previous block hash links the blocks together and prevents any block from being altered or a block being inserted between two existing blocks. In this way, each subsequent block strengthens the verification of the previ- ous block and hence the entire blockchain. The method renders the blockchain tamper-evident, lending to the key attribute of immutability.\\n\\nTo be clear, while the blockchain contains transaction data, it’s not a replacement for databases, messaging technology, trans- action processing, or business processes. Instead, the blockchain contains verified proof of transactions. However, while blockchain essentially serves as a database for recording transactions, its benefits extend far beyond those of a traditional database. Most notably, it removes the possibility of tampering by a malicious actor (for example, a database administrator).\\n\\nWhat Makes a Blockchain Suitable for Business?\\n\\nInstead of having a blockchain that relies on the exchange of cryptocurrencies with anonymous users on a public network (as is the case with Bitcoin), a blockchain for business is a private, per- missioned network with known identities and without the need for cryptocurrencies.\\n\\n14 Blockchain For Dummies, 2nd IBM Limited Edition\\n\\nThese materials are © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

What is new is the concept of a shared, distributed ledger — an immutable record of all trans- actions on the network, a record that all network participants can access. With a shared ledger, transactions are recorded only once, eliminating the duplication of effort that’s typical of tra- ditional business networks.
