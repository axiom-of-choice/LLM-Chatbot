Merchants must pay the high costs of onboarding, which often involves considerable paperwork and a time-consuming vetting process.\\n\\n» Half of the world’s people don’t have access to bank\\n\\naccounts, requiring them to develop parallel payment systems to conduct transactions.\\n\\n» Limited transparency and inconsistent information hinder the efficient movement of goods in the shipping industry.\\n\\nTransaction volumes worldwide are growing exponentially and will surely magnify the complexities, vulnerabilities, inefficien- cies, and costs of current transaction systems.

And transaction volumes are exploding with the rise of Internet of Things (IoT) — autonomous objects, such as refrigerators that buy groceries when supplies are running low and cars that deliver themselves to your door, stop- ping for fuel along the way.\\n\\nTo address these challenges and others, the world needs faster payment networks that provide mechanisms to establish trust, require no specialized equipment, have no chargebacks or monthly fees, and offer a collective bookkeeping solution for ensuring transparency and trust.\\n\\nThe emergence of Bitcoin\\n\\nOne solution that’s been developed to address the complexities, vulnerabilities, inefficiencies, and costs of current transaction systems is Bitcoin — the digital currency launched in 2009 by a mysterious person (or persons) known only by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.', metadata={'chunk': 3.0, 'data_source': 'Local', 'id': '5aecc62b86cc4d32b781ae6f7b679894', 'page': 'None', 'source': 'Blockchain%20for%20Dummies.pdf'}),\n",

Think of blockchain as an oper-ating system, such as Microsoft Windows or MacOS, and Bitcoin as only one of the many applications that can run on that operat-ing system. Blockchain provides the means for recording Bitcoin transactions\\xa0— the shared ledger\\xa0— but this shared ledger can be used to record any transaction and track the movement of any asset whether tangible, intangible, or digital. For example, block-chain enables securities to be settled in minutes instead of days. It \\ncan also be used to help companies manage the flow of goods and \\nrelated payments, or enable manufacturers to share production logs with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and regula-tors to reduce product recalls.\\nThe takeaway lesson: Bitcoin and blockchain are not the same. \\nBlockchain provides the means to record and store Bitcoin trans -\\nactions, but blockchain has many uses beyond Bitcoin. Bitcoin is \\nonly the first use case for blockchain.\\nRevolutionizing the Traditional \\nBusiness Network\\nWith traditional methods for recording transactions and track -\\ning assets, participants on a network keep their own ledgers and \\nother records. This traditional method can be expensive, partially because it involves intermediaries that charge fees for their ser -\\nvices. It’s clearly inefficient due to delays in executing agreements and the duplication of effort required to maintain numerous led-gers. It’s also vulnerable because if a central system (for example, a bank) is compromised due to fraud, cyberattack, or a simple mistake, the entire business network is affected.\\nBusiness networks also use blockchain. The blockchain architec -\\nture gives participants the ability to share a ledger that’s updated \\nthrough peer-to-peer replication each time a transaction occurs. Peer-to-peer replication  means that each participant (also called \\na node) in the network acts as both a publisher and a subscriber.', metadata={'chunk': 0.0, 'data_source': 'Local', 'id': '53b09eac9aaf43d2b49314af11e293d6', 'page': '10', 'source': 'Blockchain%20for%20Dummies.pdf'}),\n",

In this chapter, I tackle that topic by taking you behind the scenes of a blockchain network without getting overly technical.\\n\\nHere, you get a glimpse of how blockchain stores transactions in a way that prevents recorded transactions from being changed. You discover the four concepts that form the foundation of a blockchain for business, and you meet the network participants to learn the various roles they play.\\n\\nWhy It’s Called “Blockchain”\\n\\nBlockchain owes its name to the way it stores transaction data — in blocks that are linked together to form a chain (see Figure 2-1). As the number of transactions grows, so does the blockchain. Blocks record and confirm the time and sequence of transactions, which are then logged into the blockchain within a discrete net- work governed by rules agreed on by the network participants.\\n\\nCHAPTER 2 Taking a Look at How Blockchain Works 13\\n\\nThese materials are © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Any dissemination, distribution, or unauthorized use is strictly prohibited.\\n\\nFIGURE 2-1: Blockchain stores transaction records in a series of connected blocks.\\n\\nEach block contains a hash (a digital fingerprint or unique identi- fier), timestamped batches of recent valid transactions, and the hash of the previous block. The previous block hash links the blocks together and prevents any block from being altered or a block being inserted between two existing blocks. In this way, each subsequent block strengthens the verification of the previ- ous block and hence the entire blockchain. The method renders the blockchain tamper-evident, lending to the key attribute of immutability.\\n\\nTo be clear, while the blockchain contains transaction data, it’s not a replacement for databases, messaging technology, trans- action processing, or business processes. Instead, the blockchain contains verified proof of transactions. However, while blockchain essentially serves as a database for recording transactions, its benefits extend far beyond those of a traditional database. Most notably, it removes the possibility of tampering by a malicious actor (for example, a database administrator).\\n\\nWhat Makes a Blockchain Suitable for Business?\\n\\nInstead of having a blockchain that relies on the exchange of cryptocurrencies with anonymous users on a public network (as is the case with Bitcoin), a blockchain for business is a private, per- missioned network with known identities and without the need for cryptocurrencies.\\n\\n14 Blockchain For Dummies, 2nd IBM Limited Edition\\n\\nThese materials are © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

What is new is the concept of a shared, distributed ledger — an immutable record of all trans- actions on the network, a record that all network participants can access. With a shared ledger, transactions are recorded only once, eliminating the duplication of effort that’s typical of tra- ditional business networks.
