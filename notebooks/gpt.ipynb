In the current year, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that crop insurance policy will cost slightly more than the current commodity policies. And according to CBO projections for the next 10 years the estimated annual cost for commodity policy in the farm bill is $6.6 billion on average (before the expected reductions are made as part of this farm bill process), while the estimated annual cost for crop insurance policy is $8.8 billion on average.
