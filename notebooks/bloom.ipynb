He was also the Prime Minister of Italy from 1922 until 1943. He was the leader of the National Fascist Party.\\n\\nBiography\\n\\nEarly life\\nBenito Mussolini was named after Benito Juarez, a Mexican opponent of the political power of the Roman Catholic Church, by his anticlerical (a person who opposes the political interference of the Roman Catholic Church in secular affairs) father. Mussolini\\'s father was a blacksmith. Before being involved in politics, Mussolini was a newspaper editor (where he learned all his propaganda skills) and elementary school teacher.\\n\\nAt first, Mussolini was a socialist, but when he wanted Italy to join the First World War, he was thrown out of the socialist party. He \\'invented\\' a new ideology, Fascism, much out of Nationalist\\xa0and Conservative views.\\n\\nRise to power and becoming dictator\\nIn 1922, he took power by having a large group of men, \"Black Shirts,\" march on Rome and threaten to take over the government. King Vittorio Emanuele III gave in, allowed him to form a government, and made him prime minister. In the following five years, he gained power, and in 1927 created the OVRA, his personal secret police force. Using the agency to arrest, scare, or murder people against his regime, Mussolini was dictator\\xa0of Italy by the end of 1927. Only the King and his own Fascist party could challenge his power.', metadata={'chunk': 0.0, 'source': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito%20Mussolini', 'title': 'Benito Mussolini', 'wiki-id': '6754'}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content='Fascism as practiced by Mussolini\\nMussolini\\'s form of Fascism, \"Italian Fascism\"- unlike Nazism, the racist ideology that Adolf Hitler followed- was different and less destructive than Hitler\\'s. Although a believer in the superiority of the Italian nation and national unity, Mussolini, unlike Hitler, is quoted \"Race? It is a feeling, not a reality. Nothing will ever make me believe that biologically pure races can be shown to exist today\".\\n\\nMussolini wanted Italy to become a new Roman Empire. In 1923, he attacked the island of Corfu, and in 1924, he occupied the city state of Fiume. In 1935, he attacked the African country Abyssinia (now called Ethiopia). His forces occupied it in 1936. Italy was thrown out of the League of Nations because of this aggression. In 1939, he occupied the country Albania. In 1936, Mussolini signed an alliance with Adolf Hitler, the dictator of Germany.\\n\\nFall from power and death\\nIn 1940, he sent Italy into the Second World War on the side of the Axis countries. Mussolini attacked Greece, but he failed to conquer it. In 1943, the Allies landed in Southern Italy. The Fascist party and King Vittorio Emanuel III deposed Mussolini and put him in jail, but he was set free by the Germans, who made him ruler of the Italian Social Republic puppet state which was in a small part of Central Italy. When the war was almost over, Mussolini tried to escape to Switzerland with his mistress, Clara Petacci, but they were both captured and shot by partisans. Mussolini\\'s dead body was hanged upside-down, together with his mistress and some of Mussolini\\'s helpers, on a pole at a gas station in the village of Millan, which is near the border  between Italy and Switzerland.', metadata={'chunk': 1.0, 'source': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito%20Mussolini', 'title': 'Benito Mussolini', 'wiki-id': '6754'}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content='Fascism is a far-right form of government in which most of the country\\'s power is held by one ruler. Fascist governments are usually totalitarian and authoritarian one-party states. Under fascism, the economy and other parts of society are heavily and closely controlled by the government, usually by using a form of authoritarian corporatism. The government uses violence to arrest, kill or otherwise stop anyone it does not like.\\n\\nThree large fascist countries were Italy under Benito Mussolini, Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler, and Spain under Francisco Franco.\\n\\nMussolini invented fascism in Italy in the late 1910s and developed it fully in the 1930s. When Hitler came to power in Germany in the 1930s, he copied Mussolini. Mussolini wrote a political paper, which is called The Doctrine of Fascism in English. He started writing it in 1927, but it was only published in 1932. Most of it was probably written by Giovanni Gentile, an Italian philosopher.\\n\\nMain ideas\\nNot all scholars agree on what fascism is. Philosopher Jason Stanley of Yale University says it is \"a cult of the leader who promises national restoration in the face of humiliation brought on by supposed communists, Marxists and minorities and immigrants who are supposedly posing a threat to the character and the history of a nation.\" That is, fascism focuses on one person as leader, fascism says communism is bad, and fascism says that at least one group of people is bad and has caused the nation\\'s problems. This group could be people from other countries or groups of people within the country. Under Hitler\\'s fascist Germany, the government blamed Jews, communists, homosexuals, the disabled, Roma and other people for Germany\\'s problems, arrested those people, and took them to camps to be killed.\\n\\nIn 2003, Laurence W. Britt wrote \"14 Defining Characteristics of Fascism\":', metadata={'chunk': 0.0, 'source': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism', 'title': 'Fascism', 'wiki-id': '15210'}),\n",

The Pope, who was angry, said that he was a prisoner to keep Catholic people from being active in politics. That was the year of Italian unification.\\n\\nItaly participated in World War I. It was an ally of Great Britain, France, and Russia against the Central Powers. Almost all of Italy\\'s fighting was on the Eastern border, near Austria. After the \"Caporetto defeat\", Italy thought they would lose the war. But, in 1918, the Central Powers surrendered.

    "'Using only the following context: Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was an Austrian-born German politician and the leader of Nazi Germany. He became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, after a democratic election in 1932. He became Führer (leader) of Nazi Germany in 1934.\\n\\nHitler led the NSDAP, or the Nazi Party from 1921. When in power, the Nazis created a dictatorship called the Third Reich. In 1933, they blocked out all other political parties. This gave Hitler absolute power.\\n\\nHitler ordered the invasion of Poland in 1939, and this started World War II. Because of Hitler, at least 50 million people died. During World War II, Hitler was the Commander-in-Chief of the German Armed Forces and made all the important decisions. This was part of the so-called Führerprinzip. He shot himself on 30 April 1945, as the Soviet Army got to Berlin, because he did not want to be captured alive by the Soviet Union.\\n\\nHitler and the Nazi regime were responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 28.7 million soldiers and people died as a result of military action in Europe.\\n\\nNazi forces committed many war crimes during the war. They were doing what Hitler told them to do. They killed their enemies or put them in concentration camps and death camps. Hitler and his men persecuted and killed Jews and other ethnic, religious, and political minorities. In what is called the Holocaust, the Nazis killed six million Jews, Roma people, homosexuals, Slavs, and many other groups of people.\n",
